        <h2>1. Contract Overview</h2>
        <p>By entering into a contract with Snack Ranger, you agree to the terms outlined below. This agreement lasts 12 months, starting from the installation date of the vending machines at your location.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="container my-5 section-dark">
        <h2>2. Initial 3-Month Probation Period</h2>
        <p>The first three months act as a probation period. Either party can request machine removal during this time without penalty, voiding the contract.</p>
        <p>At probation’s end, we’ll evaluate machine performance. If both sides agree the setup isn’t working, the contract may end with no further obligations.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="container my-5 section-dark">
        <h2>3. Contract Continuation After Probation</h2>
        <p>If the probation period succeeds and both parties agree, the contract automatically extends for 9 more months. This period allows performance review and machine adjustments as needed.</p>
        <p>After 12 months total, we’ll meet to discuss renewing, amending, or ending the agreement based on results.</p>
